-Each folder contains WAV files for the musical tracks. 

-Some tracks will be labeled as "loop" or "non-loop". 

-Tracks marked as "Full" are the full musical tracks. 

-Tracks without the "Full" are smaller loops created from the full track.
Please note: smaller loops were not designed to be pieced together to create a longer piece of music. 
You can try it though! :)

-Some tracks will be marked as "Layer", tracks marked as layers can be vertically stacked on top 
of each other for non-linear music possibilities.
